# Exploring-Gender-Differences-in-Mental-Health-Treatment-Coping-Mechanisms-and-Social-Challenges
This project investigates gender-based disparities in mental health treatment-seeking behavior, coping mechanisms, and social challenges. Leveraging Apache Spark for distributed data processing and Python for analysis, we aim to uncover insights for targeted interventions using a dataset of 292,000+ mental health records sourced from Kaggle.
